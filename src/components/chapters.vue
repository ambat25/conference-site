                        GDGs are local groups of developers who are specifically interested in Google products and APIs. Each local group is called a GDG chapter and can host a variety of technical activities for developers - from just a few people getting together to watch our latest videos, to large gatherings with demos and tech talks, to hackathons.
                        <br>
                        DevFests are community-led, developer events hosted by GDG chapters around the globe focused on community building and learning about Googleâ€™s technologies. Each DevFest is inspired by and uniquely tailored to the needs of the developer community and region that hosts it.
